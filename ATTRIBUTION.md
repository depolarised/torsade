## Source Data Licenses and Attribution

Artefaux does **NOT** redistribute derived signals from source datasets. Users must obtain source data independently from PhysioNet and regenerate the corpus via `make download && make regenerate`.

Each source dataset carries its own license. When using Artefaux, you must comply with and cite each source dataset:

### 1. PTB-XL v1.0.3

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)

**Citation:**
```
Wagner, P., Strodthoff, N., Bousseljot, R.-D., Samek, W., & Schaeffter, T. (2020).
"PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset."
Scientific Data, 7, 154.
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0495-6
```

**Access:** https://doi.org/10.13026/g4xw-ba04

**How Artefaux uses PTB-XL:**
- Source of clean 12-lead ECG parents for the real-noise pairs and engineering cases.
- Source of the naturally-poor records, selected via its technical-validation quality-flag columns
  (`static_noise`/`burst_noise`/`baseline_drift`/`electrodes_problems`).

**Your obligation:** If you use PTB-XL via Artefaux, you must cite the Wagner et al. (2020) paper and provide the PhysioNet DOI.

### 2. PTB-XL+ v1.0.1

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY-4.0)

**Citation:**
```
Strodthoff, N., Mehari, T., Nagel, C., Aston, P. J., Sundar, A., Graff, C.,
Kanters, J. K., Haverkamp, W., Dössel, O., Loewe, A., Bär, M., & Schaeffter, T. (2023).
"PTB-XL+, a comprehensive electrocardiographic feature dataset."
Scientific Data, 10, 279. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02153-8
```

**Access:** https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl-plus/1.0.1/

**How Artefaux uses PTB-XL+:**
- **Cited and version-pinned only — not consumed by Artefaux v1.** It is the provenance of the Uni-G/Glasgow
  interpretation layer, for which the `glasgow_statements` label field is reserved. That field ships **empty**;
  wiring it is deferred to a future version. (The PTB-XL quality flags come from PTB-XL itself, not PTB-XL+.)

**Your obligation:** If a future version consumes PTB-XL+ annotations, cite the Strodthoff et al. (2023) source.

### 3. MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB) v1.0.0

**License:** Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0 (ODC-BY-1.0) — **attribution required**.  
**Provenance:** Created at the Beth Israel Hospital / MIT (Moody, Muldrow & Mark) and distributed by PhysioNet. Not public domain; you must retain the attribution below.

**Citation:**
```
Moody, G. B., Muldrow, W. G., & Mark, R. G. (1984).
"A noise stress test for arrhythmia detectors."
In Proceedings of the 11th IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference,
Boston, MA, USA (pp. 381–384).
```

**Access:** https://doi.org/10.13026/c2dv-6e40

**How Artefaux uses NSTDB:**
- Primary source of real noise segments (electrode motion, muscle artefact, baseline wander).
- Resampled from native 360 Hz to 500 Hz using scipy.signal.resample_poly.
- Mixed with PTB-XL clean parents at SNR levels {−6, 0, 6, 12, 18} dB to create 30 real-noise stress-test pairs.

**Your obligation:** If you use NSTDB noise via Artefaux, cite the Moody et al. (1984) paper and the PhysioNet DOI.

### 4. Motion Artifact Contaminated ECG Database (MACECGDB) v1.0.0

**License:** Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0 (ODC-BY-1.0)  
**Restrictions:** Attribution required; redistribution of derived data must preserve attribution.

**Citation:**
```
Behravan, V., Glover, N. E., Farry, R., Shoaib, M., & Chiang, P. Y. (2015).
Motion Artifact Contaminated ECG Database (version 1.0.0). PhysioNet.
https://doi.org/10.13026/C2JP4G
```

**Access:** https://doi.org/10.13026/C2JP4G

**How Artefaux uses MACECGDB:**
- Source of real motion traces (standing / walking / single-jump) for a few "wild" engineering extremes via the `motion_swing` recipe op.
- Unlike NSTDB, the underlying cardiac signal is **not** suppressed, so these motion traces carry residual ECG — a harder, more ECG-like adversarial artefact — and are labelled as a motion source, not clean noise.

**Your obligation:** If you use MACECGDB data via Artefaux, comply with the ODC-BY-1.0 license and cite the Behravan et al. (2015) database.

### 5. PhysioNet Infrastructure

**Citation:**
```
Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A. N., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C.,
Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C.-K., & Stanley, H. E. (2000).

Circulation, 101(23), e215–e220.
https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.e215
```

**Access:** https://physionet.org/

**How Artefaux uses PhysioNet:**
- Distribution platform for the source datasets (PTB-XL, PTB-XL+, NSTDB, MACECGDB).
- Provides data integrity (checksums, version control) and persistent DOI assignments.

**Your obligation:** Acknowledge PhysioNet as the repository infrastructure when citing source datasets.

---

## Excluded Datasets

**MIMIC-IV (MIMIC-IV-ECG)** is explicitly **NOT** used in Artefaux v1, despite being a high-quality ECG resource, because:

1. **Credentialed access required:** MIMIC-IV requires PhysioNet account registration and agreement to a research data use agreement (RDUA). Not all users have access.
2. **Non-redistributable:** MIMIC-IV records cannot be redistributed, even under anonymous or de-identified form.
3. **Reproducibility constraint:** Including MIMIC-IV would prevent users without credentials from regenerating the full corpus.

If you wish to supplement Artefaux with MIMIC-IV-ECG data for your own research, follow the MIMIC-IV RDUA terms directly and cite it separately.
