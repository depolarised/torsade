"""Electrode-domain lead algebra and corruption.

The 12-lead ECG is not twelve independent channels: the limb leads are linear
combinations of three limb-electrode potentials (RA, LA, LL) and the chest leads
are each referenced to Wilson's Central Terminal (WCT), which is itself the mean
of the three limb electrodes. A loose or noisy *electrode* therefore corrupts a
predictable *set* of leads, not one arbitrary trace.

Artefaux models this exactly. Given a clean, Einthoven-consistent 12-lead record we
recover the electrode potentials (in the RA-as-reference gauge), add artefact to
one or more electrodes, then rederive all twelve leads. This is the physically
faithful way to simulate an acquired-but-degraded ECG.

**Assumption — the WCT is not truly zero.** The classical WCT ``(RA+LA+LL)/3`` is
an approximation; the real central-terminal potential varies through the cardiac
cycle and with electrode placement. Artefaux uses the classical definition and
recomputes it after corruption, which is the standard modelling choice; downstream
users should read this as an idealised electrode model, not a torso forward model.
