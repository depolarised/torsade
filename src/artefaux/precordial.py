"""Precordial (chest-lead) corruption with shared + independent components.

A loose chest electrode disturbs mainly its own lead, but adjacent electrodes on
the same acquisition often share a common motion component. Copying an identical
noise trace into two leads looks artificial; Artefaux instead builds each lead's
noise as a weighted mix of a shared component and an independent one, e.g.

    n_V4 = 0.8·n_shared + 0.2·n_1,   n_V5 = 0.7·n_shared + 0.3·n_2

so adjacent leads are correlated but distinct.
